# SocialBook

SocialBook is a frontend clone of Facebook. This project focuses solely on replicating the visual aspects of Facebook's interface. It does not include any backend functionality or user interactions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements to resemble Facebook's design.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds any necessary frontend behavior.

## Getting Started

To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Ensure that the `styles.css` and `script.js` files are in the same directory as the `index.html` file.

## Features
